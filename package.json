Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.\r 4. Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.\r 5. Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.\r 6. Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book.\r 7. Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.",
